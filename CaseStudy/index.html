        <h1>Overview</h1>

        <p>For this project, I developed a cookbook website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP with the goal of
            exporting over 40 unique recipes into a database, which would be displayed via my website. I was required to
            add searching and filtering functionality for the site as well. I worked with a team to import the recipe
            data into a spreadsheet, which was exported into a MySQL database to be used for my individual site. After
            creating wireframes for my initial design, I coded a functioning prototype in HTML before any database
            content was added. Then, I inserted the proper content from the database via PHP and refined the filtering
            and searching with JavaScript, meeting the project’s standards and completing a viable product.
        </p>

        <h1>The Context and Challenges</h1>

        <p>I developed a cookbook website where users can interact with over 40 different recipes, read their
            descriptions, follow their steps and instructions, and search for specific recipes and also filter through
            them. I had 10 weeks to develop the entire website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and light JavaScript
            coding, as well as requiring PHP code to connect to a local database, which contains the data for each
            recipe. </p>

        <p>The problem was that I had none of the recipe data to start with, and had to fill my database in manually.
            Each recipe’s information was in a PDF, where the relevant data had to be manually extracted into a
            spreadsheet to be exported as a CSV file, which could then be imported into a MySQL database. To speed up
            this process, I teamed up with other students to divide and conquer the extraction work, where we created a
            spreadsheet that we could all use individually for our projects.</p>

        <p>So now the goal was to build a website from HTML and CSS coding that met the minimum viable standard of
            recipes, searching, and filtering, and then replace it with PHP functionality that connects to my database
            to display all of the unique recipe information, as opposed to manually hard-coding every recipe in.</p>

        <h1>The Process</h1>

        <p>Starting with the design of the website itself, I took inspiration from other basic recipe websites, such as
            allrecipes.com and the recipes found on foodnetwork.com as well. To map out the skeleton of my website, I
            created wireframes in Figma to illustrate where content would ideally be placed, as well as creating
            different references for different screen sizes to ease the process of adding further responsiveness</p>

        <p>Then, I got to work developing the initial “Alpha” version of the site, which was only the HTML and CSS,
            before any database connection was added. This Alpha was made to ensure the structure of the website was
            already created and ready to have the database content inserted into it to avoid having to work on both at
            the same time. Instead, I added templates for each major page that would eventually have their final content
            inserted once the connection was established.</p>

        <p>Once the Alpha was completed, all that was left to do was add the content from my database and make any final
            touches to the site’s presentation.
        </p>

        <h1>The Solution
        </h1>

        <p>This brings me to the final version of the project, which includes the final additions of the database
            content into the main pages. For starters, the home page now has the proper images and titles displayed for
            every recipe instead of placeholders.
        </p>

        <p>The single recipe flow now shows every unique image, ingredient list, and instruction, dynamically added
            based on how many of each appear in the database row corresponding to the current recipe. This means that
            recipes with a different number of ingredients, images, or steps do not break the site when trying to load,
            meaning all recipes can be viewed properly.</p>

        <p>The searching and filtering functions work by searching the database for identical or similar phrases that
            appear in the database’s columns for names, ingredients, and descriptions. This way, the database can be
            changed without breaking the search/filter functionality.</p>

        <p>Lastly, two additional pages don’t use the database’s content. First is the Help page, which describes in
            detail the site’s functions and how to use them. Second is the Results Not Found page, which only appears
            when a user clicks on the Search button without anything inputted in the search field. These pages help to
            smooth the overall experience, assisting users who may not understand the website’s functions or
            accidentally search without inputting any criteria.</p>

        <h1>The Results</h1>

        <p>Overall, this was a successful project that was able to meet its goals of viability, providing all recipe
            content with working searching and filtering functionality. Every provided recipe was inserted properly into
            my database, which was connected to my site with PHP code as required. So by the standards set for this
            project, this website is fully complete and functional.
