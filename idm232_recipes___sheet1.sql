In a medium pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 1/2 cups of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.\r\n[IMG3]\r\nStep 2. \r\nPrepare the ingredients & make the glaze: While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots; quarter lengthwise, then halve crosswise. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Remove and discard the stems of the kale; finely chop the leaves. Using a peeler, remove the lime rind, avoiding the white pith; mince to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Halve the lime crosswise. Halve the orange; squeeze the juice into a bowl, straining out any seeds. Whisk in the chile paste and 2 tablespoons of water until smooth.\r\n[IMG4]\r\nStep 3. \r\nPlace the sliced carrots on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.\r\n[IMG5]\r\nStep 4. \r\nWhile the carrots roast, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the chopped kale; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly wilted. Add 1/3 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until the kale has wilted and the water has cooked off. Transfer to the pot of cooked rice. Stir to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.\r\n[IMG6]\r\nStep 5. \r\nWhile the carrots continue to roast, pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 4 to 6 minutes on the first side, or until browned. Flip and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the glaze and cook, frequently spooning the glaze over the chicken, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken is coated and cooked through. Turn off the heat; stir the butter and the juice of 1 lime half into the glaze until the butter has melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n[IMG7]\r\nStep 6. \r\nFinish the rice & serve your dish: To the pot of cooked rice and kale, add the lime zest, crème fraîche, raisins, and the juice of the remaining lime half. Stir to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the glazed chicken with the finished rice and roasted carrots. Top the chicken with the remaining glaze from the pan.

Wash and dry the fresh produce. Using a sharp, sturdy knife, carefully halve the squash lengthwise; using a spoon, scoop out and discard the pulp and seeds. Place in a baking dish, cut side up. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; arrange cut side down. Fill the dish with 1/4 inch of water. Roast 32 to 35 minutes, or until the cut side of the squash is tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.\r\n[IMG3]\r\nStep 2.\r\nWhile the squash roasts, in a small saucepan, combine the rice, lime leaf, a big pinch of salt, and 1 cup of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat. Carefully remove and discard the lime leaf. Fluff the cooked rice with a fork. Cover and set aside in a warm place.\r\n[IMG4]\r\nStep 3. \r\nPrepare the remaining ingredients: While the rice cooks, peel and thinly slice the onion. Peel and finely chop the ginger. Quarter the lime. Cut off and discard the root end of the bok choy; thinly slice crosswise. Pick the mint leaves off the stems; discard the stems.\r\n[IMG5]\r\nStep 4. \r\nCook the aromatics: While the rice continues to cook, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced onion; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the chopped ginger; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly browned and fragrant.\r\n[IMG6]\r\nStep 5.\r\nTo the pan, add the coconut milk (shaking the can just before opening), sugar, and as much of the curry paste as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n[IMG7]\r\nStep 6. \r\nFinish the curry & serve your dish: When cool enough to handle, using a fork, scrape the flesh of the roasted squash into a bowl; separate any clumps. (The result should resemble cooked spaghetti.) Discard the skins. Add the squash and sliced bok choy to the pan of curry. Cook on medium-high, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Turn off the heat. Stir in the juice of 2 lime wedges; season with salt and pepper to taste. Top the cooked rice with the finished curry. Garnish with the mung beans and mint leaves (tearing just before adding). Serve with the remaining lime wedges on the side.
